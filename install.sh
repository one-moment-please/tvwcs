# TVWCS's installer. It installs, upgrades or removes TVWCS's Debian packages. Run it in a terminal:
#
#     wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/one-moment-please/tvwcs/main/install.sh | bash
#
# (it then downloads the release you choose), or from an unpacked release (./install.sh; it then offers to install the
# packages next to it, or to download another release). It asks every question first and changes nothing until you
# agree to the list of what it will do:
#   - with TVWCS installed: upgrade, install a different version (the prerelease, or one of the two releases before
#     the latest) or remove TVWCS;
#   - logging in automatically into TVWCS's session. Without a login screen, the first text console logs in and starts
#     it (typing tvwcs there starts it too);
#   - adding TVWCS to your usual sway session (one include line in its config), where it runs in desktop mode;
#   - on Ubuntu, removing Snap, cloud-init and the Ubuntu Pro client, each asked.
# apt installs the packages TVWCS needs with it. Supported: Debian and its family (apt), with systemd.
#
# TVWCS 4.x was installed in ~/.local/share/tvwcs, for one user, with its own login screen and i3 or sway. Upgrading
# from it removes that copy and TVWCS's old login screen (another installed login screen takes over; without one,
# greetd's text login does, and the automatic login is kept), and moves TV mode to sway. Your channels, favorites,
# options and hotkeys in ~/.config/tvwcs are kept.
#
# Options: --remove removes TVWCS. --help shows this text. (--missing, which 4.x's updater asks, lists nothing.)
# Environment: TVWCS_VERSION=package|latest|<x.y.z> answers which version (default: asked).
# The tests use TVWCS_ETC, TVWCS_RUN, TVWCS_SHARE, TVWCS_LIB, TVWCS_LOCAL, TVWCS_UNITS, TVWCS_GITHUB, TVWCS_API and TVWCS_PACKAGES (the packages
# to treat as installed) to stand in for the system.
