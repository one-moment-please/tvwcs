"""Bluetooth for Settings, through BlueZ's `bluetoothctl`. No GTK dependency.

bluetoothctl runs one command per call (non-interactive mode). Pairing registers a NoInputNoOutput agent, which
pairs headphones, speakers, gamepads and remotes ("just works"); a device that insists on typing a code (some
keyboards) has to be paired once with a full Bluetooth tool."""
