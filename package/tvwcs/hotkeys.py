"""Hotkey specs ("F2", "Shift+F2", "Mod4+space", or a lone modifier such as "Mod4") and the i3 config they produce.
No GTK dependency.

There are three sets of hotkeys, one per input device: keyboard, remote and gamepad. Each set has a key for the
Quick Menu ("menu") and one for the Applications pane ("guide"); the remote also has one that toggles fullscreen on
the focused app ("fullscreen"). Any of them may be unset (""). A gamepad sends no key presses by itself: map its
buttons to keys with a tool such as AntiMicroX, then capture those keys here. Any launch profile can have a hotkey of
its own too (see model.LaunchProfile.hotkey); it is bound here as `tvwcs launch <profile id>`.

A lone modifier (tapping Super by itself) is bound by its X keycode on release, for example
`bindcode --release 133 ...` for the left Super key. Binding it on press would steal Super from every Super+key
shortcut; on release, Super+Enter and the rest keep working."""
