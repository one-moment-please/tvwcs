"""Which launch profile opened which window. No GTK dependency.

A window is just "a Firefox window"; TVWCS cannot tell a private-session profile's window from the main profile's. To know
which profile's PIN a window falls under, TVWCS remembers the windows that appear shortly after it launches a profile.
The memory lasts for the current TVWCS session; a window it never saw opened falls back to its application's main profile."""
