"""Running a power action (sleep, reboot, shut down) as root when it needs that. No GTK dependency.

Under systemd, polkit normally lets the user at the screen do these without a password; it refuses
("Interactive authentication required") when, for instance, another user is logged in, because sway runs no
polkit agent to ask. A plain reboot or poweroff command always needs root. Then TVWCS tries,
in order: doas -n and sudo -n (a no-password rule, such as the one install.sh offers), and finally sudo -S with a
password typed into TVWCS's own dialog. The password goes to sudo through a pipe; it is never stored."""
