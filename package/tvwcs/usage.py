USAGE="""Usage: tvwcs [COMMAND]

  tvwcs                          what fits where you type it: at a text console, TVWCS's session; in a
                                 sway session with TVWCS, the Quick Menu; in another sway session or
                                 desktop, Settings; over SSH, a menu of the server mode commands
  tvwcs session                  start TVWCS's session (sway in TV mode) here, at a text console
  tvwcs settings [PAGE]          open TVWCS Settings, optionally on one page (such as sound or user)
  tvwcs lock                     lock the screen
  tvwcs server-mode on [--user=NAME]
                                 turn on server mode: NAME (you, by default) uses the TV, logs in
                                 automatically into TVWCS and has no administrator settings
  tvwcs server-mode off          turn server mode off (the automatic login stays)
  tvwcs server-mode status       say whether server mode is on, and for whom
  tvwcs start-session [--user=NAME]
                                 start TVWCS for NAME on this computer's screen now (for example over SSH)
  tvwcs --version                print TVWCS's version
  tvwcs help                     print this

Server mode and start-session ask for an administrator's password (sudo).

Used by TVWCS's sway config, hotkeys and idle timer (not usually typed):
  tvwcs launcher                 run TVWCS itself (tvwcs.conf starts it as sway starts)
  tvwcs toggle | guide           show or hide the Quick Menu, or open the applications guide
  tvwcs reload | stop            reload TVWCS's settings, or quit TVWCS
  tvwcs launch PROFILE_ID        start an application profile (its hotkey)
  tvwcs volume up|down           the volume keys: one step, stopping at 100 % (150 % with
                                 Settings > Sound > Allow over-amplification)
  tvwcs idle screen_off|lock|sleep|resume
                                 what swayidle runs when a Power and sleep time is reached
  tvwcs lock-at-start            lock straight away if Settings > User asks for it"""
