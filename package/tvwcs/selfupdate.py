"""Updating TVWCS itself from its GitHub releases: find the latest published release (or, for those who want them,
the newest prerelease), compare it with the running version, download its .deb packages and install them as root with
apt. Each merged change is released as a prerelease first and marked latest once it has been tested, so "the latest
release" is also what a prerelease rolls back to.

A release has one .deb per package: tvwcs (the program), and tvwcs-boot-logo (the logo shown while the computer starts,
installed from Settings > User). An update installs the new version of each one installed here.
No GTK here, so it can be tested without a display; the Settings panel runs these calls on a worker thread."""
