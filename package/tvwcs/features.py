"""The software each part of TVWCS needs beyond a basic install. No GTK dependency.

The installer installs what the Quick Menu, the applications list and Settings need. Each entry below needs packages
of its own; a Settings page whose software is missing offers to install it (Sound installs PipeWire, Bluetooth installs
BlueZ), and its Quick Menu icon is not shown until then. There is no on/off switch: what
is installed is used. (Before 4.0 there was a Features page with one.)"""
